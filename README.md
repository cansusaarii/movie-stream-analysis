# movie-stream-analysis

The project involves creating a relational database for a fictional movie streaming service. The goal is to analyze user behavior, movie ratings, and subscription data to generate insights about the service's performance. The database will consist of multiple related tables, including users, movies, subscriptions, and watch history. I explored user behavior, subscription trends, and movie preferences with these datasets.


# Datasets, Schema Design:
Genres Table
Users Table
Movies Table
Subscriptions Table
Watch History Table
# SQL Queries

1. User Behavior: Total Watch Time per User
2. Subscription Trends: Count of Users per Subscription Type
3. Movie Preferences: Most Popular Genres Based on Watch Count
4. Number of Movies per Genre
5. Top 5 Movies by Rating
6. Active Subscriptions: Count of Active vs. Expired Subscriptions
7. User Watch History: Number of Movies Watched by Each User
8. Average Watch Time per Movie
9. Most Watched Movies
10. Subscriptions Expiring Soon
